Feature: Engineer provides instructions to the system

  As a NASA Engineer
  I want to be able to specify a instructions file for the system to process and then have the system process those instructions
  In order to easily input a predefined set of instructions into the system and get the rovers moving 
  
  Scenario: Provide the system with instructions 
    Given I have started the system
    And I provide a instruction file called 'input1.txt'
    Then the system should read in the file and have it ready for processing
    And the system should process the file and move the rover at start position '3 3 E'
    And display the final position of the rover to the screen as '5 1 E'
    
#    Scenarios: Rover positions
#    | start position | final position |
#    | '1 2 N'        | '1 3 N'        |
#    | '3 3 E'        | '5 1 E'        |

  Scenario: Provide the system with invalid instructions
    Given I have a rover in position "0 0 N" 
    When I provide rover instructions of "MMMRMMMOMMR"
    Then the rover should move to "2 2 E"
    And report to the screen "Warning: System has received an invalid instruction '#{instruction}', exiting system. No further move instructions will be processed."
