Feature: Moving a rover around a plateu

In order for the NASA rovers to get a complete view of the surrounding terrain to send back to Earth
As a NASA Engineer
I want to be able to send commands so I can navigate a rover around the plateu

 Scenario: Moving a rover
   Given I have a plateu which is 5 units high by 5 units wide
   And a I have a rover at position 1,2 facing North
   When I give the rover the instructions LMLMLMLMM
   Then the rover should move until it reaches the position 1,3 
   And the rover should be facing North
