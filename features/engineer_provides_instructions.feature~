Feature: Engineer provides instructions to the system

  As an NASA Engineer
  I want to provide instructions to the navigation system
  In order to begin to navigate with my rovers

Scenario Outline: Provide instructions to the system
  Given I have started the system
  When I have provided the system with the instruction file 'instructions/input1.txt' 
  Then the system should read in the file
  And the system should process the file and move the rover at <starting position>
  And the system should report the <final position> of each rover to the screen
  | start position | final position |
  |                |
